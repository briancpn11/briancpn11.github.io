								  			We study the problem of classifying stationary measures on homogeneous spaces of the form G/H, where G is a connected
								  			real Lie group, and H is a closed unimodular subgroup of G. Under an assumption of relative uniform expansion, we show 
								  			that the stationary measures can be decomposed into homogeneous parts and Bernoulli convolutions. 
								  			<br><br>
								  			The main tools used are a relative version of the technique of Eskin-Lindenstrauss, and a measure classification result
								  			of linear action on real vector spaces based on a result of Bougerol.

								  			We study the problem of classifying stationary measures and orbit closures for non-abelian action 
								  			on a surface with a given smooth invariant measure. Using a result of Brown and Rodriguez Hertz, 
								  			we show that under a certain finite verifiable average growth condition, the only nonatomic stationary measure 
								  			is the given smooth invariant measure, and every orbit closure is either finite or dense. 
								  			Moreover, every point with infinite orbit equidistributes on the surface with respect to the smooth 
								  			invariant measure. This is analogous to the results of Benoist-Quint and Eskin-Lindenstrauss in the 
								  			homogeneous setting, and the result of Eskin-Mirzakhani in the setting of moduli spaces of translation 
								  			surfaces. We then apply this result to two concrete settings, namely discrete perturbation of the standard 
								  			map and Out(F_2)-action on a certain character variety. We verify the growth condition analytically in 
								  			the former setting, and verify numerically in the latter setting.

								  		<div id="absKummer" style="display:none">
								  			We give one- and two-dimensional scalar multiplication algorithms for Jacobians of genus 2 curves that operate by projecting to
								  			Kummer surfaces, where we can exploit faster and more uniform pseudomultiplication, before recovering the proper “signed” output back on the
								  			Jacobian. This extends the work of L´opez and Dahab, Okeya and Sakurai, and Brier and Joye to genus 2, and also to two-dimensional scalar
								  			multiplication. The technique is especially interesting in genus 2, because
								  			Kummer surfaces can outperform comparable elliptic curve systems.

								  		<div id="absboundedgaps" style="display:none">
								  			In their breakthrough paper in 2006, Goldston, Graham, Pintz and Yıldırım proved several results about bounded gaps 
								  			between products of two distinct primes. Frank Thorne expanded on this result, proving bounded gaps in the set of 
								  			square-free numbers with r prime factors for any r ≥ 2, all of which are in a given set of primes. His results 
								  			yield applications to the divisibility of class numbers and the triviality of ranks of elliptic curves. In this 
								  			paper, we relax the condition on the number of prime factors and prove an analogous result using a modified approach. 
								  			We then revisit Thorne’s applications and give a better bound in each case.

								  		<div id="abschrom" style="display:none">
								  			For a fixed c≥2, a c-strong coloring of the hypergraph G is a vertex coloring such that each edge e 
								  			of G covers vertices with at least min{c,|e|} distinct colors. A hypergraph is t-intersecting if the 
								  			intersection of any two of its edges contains at least t vertices. This paper addresses the question: 
								  			what is the minimum number of colors which suffices to c-strong color any t-intersecting hypergraph? 
								  			We first show that the number of colors required to c-strong color a hypergraph of size n is O(n). 
								  			Then we prove that we can use finitely many colors to 3-strong color any 2-intersecting hypergraph. 
								  			Finally, we show that 2c−1 colors are enough to c-strong color any shifted (c−1)-intersecting hypergraph, 
								  			and 2c−2 colors are enough to c-strong color any shifted t-intersecting hypergraph for t≥c. Both chromatic 
								  			numbers are optimal and match conjectured statements in which the shifted condition is removed.
